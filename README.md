# multi_factorial
Example to show how to sped up code with multiprocessing

It takes less time, the more cores you use, and the more factorial you calculate

For 8 cores:
For factorial from 10 000 multiprocessing slower in 13-14 times
For factorial from 100 000 multiprocessing faster in 4-5 times
For factorial from 500 000 multiprocessing faster in 15-16 times
